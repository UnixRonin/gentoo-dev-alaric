  PerlJammer is a network-controllable MP3 jukebox using a Perl/Tk interface,
  backed by a SQL database and designed to be used with a shared music library.
  It generates random playlists on demand, plays using a user-selected external
  MP3 player app (default: media-sound/madplay), supports individual exclusion
  lists for up to 256 different users and per-track gain control, allows
  drag-and-drop resorting of the playlist, and allows interactively linking
  songs to always be selected as a group.  It includes a network mini-remote
  with several interface options, including vertical and horizontal toolbars
  and a skinnable virtual remote.  A variety of helper tools are also included.
